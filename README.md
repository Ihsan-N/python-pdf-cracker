To get a PDF password using brute force in Python, you mainly need three things:

1. Python Environment: Install Python on your computer.

2. PDF Cracking Library: Use a library like PyPDF2 or pikepdf, which can try to open PDFs with different passwords.

3. Brute Force Logic: Write a script that generates many password combinations and tries each one to unlock the PDF.
